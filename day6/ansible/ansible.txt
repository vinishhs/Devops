📦 Ansible Automation Process

Ansible is an agentless automation tool used for:

Configuration management

Application deployment

Provisioning

Orchestration

It connects to target machines using SSH and executes tasks defined in YAML playbooks.

🧭 Step-by-Step Ansible Flow
1️⃣ Install Ansible (Control Node)

Install Ansible on the machine from where automation will run.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible -y

Verify
ansible --version

2️⃣ Prepare Managed Nodes

Ensure the target systems have:

SSH enabled

Python installed

Network connectivity from control node

Test manually
ssh user@target-ip


If login works without issues, Ansible can manage the host.

3️⃣ Create Inventory File

Inventory defines which machines Ansible should manage.

Default location:

/etc/ansible/hosts


Example:

[web]
192.168.1.10

[db]
192.168.1.20


You can also create a custom inventory file.

4️⃣ Test Connectivity (Ping Module)
ansible all -m ping


Expected result:

SUCCESS


This confirms SSH + Python access.

5️⃣ Write a Playbook

Playbooks are written in YAML and describe the desired state.

Example – install_nginx.yml
---
- name: Install Nginx
  hosts: web
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

6️⃣ Run the Playbook
ansible-playbook install_nginx.yml


Ansible will:

Connect to hosts

Execute tasks

Show results

7️⃣ Verify Changes

Login to the managed node and confirm.

systemctl status nginx


Or check in browser:

http://<server-ip>

🧠 What Happens Internally?

Reads inventory

Connects via SSH

Transfers module

Executes tasks

Returns output

Cleans temporary files

No agent installation required.

📁 Recommended Project Structure
ansible-project/
│── inventory
│── playbook.yml
│── roles/
│── group_vars/
│── host_vars/


This structure helps in organizing large environments.

🚀 Common Ad-Hoc Commands

Ad-hoc commands are one-time operations without writing playbooks.

Install Package
ansible web -m apt -a "name=git state=present" --become

Restart Service
ansible web -m service -a "name=nginx state=restarted" --become

Check Disk Space
ansible all -m command -a "df -h"

🔐 Key Features of Ansible

✔ Agentless architecture
✔ Uses SSH (secure)
✔ Human-readable YAML
✔ Idempotent (no repeated unnecessary changes)
✔ Easy to scale to hundreds of servers
✔ Strong community modules
