📌 What is Terraform?

Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used to define, provision, and manage cloud and on-prem resources using configuration files.

Instead of manually creating servers, networks, or security groups, we write code.

🧭 Terraform Workflow
Write → Init → Validate → Plan → Apply → Verify → Destroy (if needed)

1️⃣ Write Configuration Files

Create .tf files describing the infrastructure.

Example resources:

Provider (AWS/Azure/GCP)

Virtual machines / EC2

Security groups

Key pairs

Networks

Example:

provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "myvm" {
  ami           = "ami-xxxxxxxx"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
}

2️⃣ Initialize Terraform
terraform init


What happens:

Downloads provider plugins

Prepares backend

Creates .terraform folder

Locks provider versions

Run this first time or whenever providers change.

3️⃣ Validate Configuration
terraform validate


Checks:
✔ syntax
✔ required arguments
✔ internal consistency

Does not contact cloud.

4️⃣ Preview Changes (Execution Plan)
terraform plan


Shows:

What will be created

What will be modified

What will be destroyed

No resources are built yet.

Think of it as a dry run.

5️⃣ Apply Changes
terraform apply


Terraform will:

Ask for confirmation

Create resources in the cloud

Generate/update terraform.tfstate

You can skip confirmation:

terraform apply -auto-approve

6️⃣ Verify Resources

After apply:

Login to cloud console

Check instances

Verify IP, security rules, etc.

7️⃣ Update Infrastructure

Modify .tf files → run:

terraform plan
terraform apply


Terraform compares state vs new config and adjusts.

8️⃣ Destroy Infrastructure (Avoid Billing 💰)
terraform destroy


Deletes everything defined in .tf files.

Useful for:

Labs

Practice

Avoiding unexpected charges

📂 Important Terraform Files
File	Purpose
.tf	Infrastructure definition
terraform.tfstate	Current infrastructure record
.terraform/	Provider plugins

🔁 Master–Slave Architecture

Master–Slave (also called Primary–Replica or Leader–Follower) is a system design where one main node controls and other nodes follow its instructions.

It is widely used in databases, distributed systems, and DevOps pipelines.

📌 Basic Idea

Master → makes decisions, accepts writes/updates

Slaves → replicate data, serve reads, execute assigned tasks

🧭 How It Works
Client → Master → Slaves
           ↓
       Replication


Client sends request to Master.

Master processes it.

Changes are copied to Slave nodes.

Slaves stay synchronized.

🎯 Responsibilities
Master Node

Accepts write operations

Maintains authoritative data

Sends updates to slaves

Handles coordination

Slave Nodes

Receive replicated data

Serve read requests

Provide backup / redundancy

Reduce master load

✅ Advantages

✔ High availability
✔ Load balancing
✔ Backup & recovery
✔ Better performance for reads
✔ Scalability

❌ Disadvantages

❌ Master is single point of failure (if no failover)
❌ Replication delay may occur
❌ Setup can be complex

🧱 Real-World Examples

Master–Slave is used in:

MySQL replication

Redis primary–replica

Apache Hadoop NameNode & DataNodes

CI/CD controller & agents

🔄 Failover (Advanced)

If Master fails:

One Slave can be promoted as new Master

System continues working

This improves reliability.

📊 Use Cases

Database replication

Distributed computing

Data backup

Read-heavy applications

Cluster management
