🖥️ LINUX, WINDOWS, VM & BASIC COMMANDS
WINDOWS OS

Windows is a paid, GUI-based operating system developed by Microsoft.
It is widely used for personal computers, office work, and gaming.

Command-line interfaces available:

Command Prompt

PowerShell

Windows is user-friendly but offers less control for low-level system configuration compared to Linux.

LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM

Linux is free and open-source.
It is known for stability, security, and is heavily used in servers, cloud, and DevOps environments.

Most tasks are performed using the terminal, which enables automation and scripting.

Popular distributions:

Ubuntu

CentOS

Red Hat Enterprise Linux

WINDOWS VS LINUX

Windows is convenient for daily personal use.

Linux is preferred in development and production because it offers:

Strong security

Better performance

High customization

Powerful automation

Native DevOps tool support

VIRTUAL MACHINE (VM)

A Virtual Machine is a system that runs inside another computer.

It allows multiple operating systems to share the same hardware.

Example: Running Ubuntu inside Windows using VMware Workstation.

Terms:

Host OS → Main operating system

Guest OS → OS running inside VM

Network Modes:

NAT → Uses host internet

Bridged → Gets its own IP in the network

WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

Windows Subsystem for Linux allows Linux commands to run directly on Windows without creating a virtual machine.

Advantages

Fast startup

Lightweight

Easy file sharing with Windows

Limitation

Not full virtualization

Limited for advanced server simulations

VMWARE

VMware Workstation is used to create and manage virtual machines.

Basic workflow:
Install VMware → Load OS ISO → Install OS → Start practicing.

UBUNTU INSTALLATION (BASIC FLOW)

Create a new VM

Attach ISO file

Allocate CPU / RAM / Disk
